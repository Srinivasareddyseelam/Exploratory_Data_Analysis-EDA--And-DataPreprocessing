# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing

## 📌 Overview
Data preprocessing is a **crucial step** in any machine learning pipeline. Raw data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions, making it essential to clean and transform it before model training. 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a **comprehensive guide to EDA and data preprocessing**, ensuring high-quality inputs for machine learning models. 

## 🔍 Key Topics Covered
### 🔹 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis helps in understanding the dataset’s structure and identifying patterns, inconsistencies, and potential issues. In this notebook, we cover:

- **Understanding the dataset structure**: Displaying the first few rows, data types, and summary statistics.
- **Handling missing values**: Identifying and addressing missing data using imputation techniques.
- **Outlier detection and treatment**: Using visualization techniques (box plots, histograms) to detect and cap outliers.
- **Handling data skewness**: Log transformation, power transformation, and other normalization techniques.
- **Visualizing relationships**: Scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots to identify relationships between variables.

### 🔹 2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing ensures that the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for machine learning models. The following steps are included:

#### ✅ Handling Categorical Features
- **One-Hot Encoding (OHE)**: Converts categorical variables into binary columns.
- **Label Encoding**: Assigns numerical values to categorical labels.

#### ✅ Feature Scaling and Transformation
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scales data between 0 and 1.
- **Standardization (Z-score normalization)**: Converts data to a normal distribution.

#### ✅ Feature Engineering
- **Creating new features**: Deriving new features based on existing ones.
- **Feature selection**: Removing redundant or highly correlated features to improve model performance.

## 📚 Libraries Used
The notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:

| Library    | Purpose |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `pandas`  | Data manipulation and preprocessing |
| `numpy`   | Numerical computations |
| `matplotlib` | Basic visualization |
| `seaborn`  | Advanced visualization |
